                        Each entry in this glossary has the following parts:<br>*<br>     the term being defined, set in boldface.<br>*<br>     optional pronunciation, enclosed in square brackets and set in<br>     boldface, as in the following example: pronounced 'a ,list .  The<br>     pronunciation key follows Webster's Third New International Dictionary<br>     the English Language, Unabridged, except that "e" is used to notate<br>     the schwa (upside-down "e") character.<br>*<br>     the part or parts of speech, set in italics.  If a term can be used<br>     as several parts of speech, there is a separate definition for each<br>     part of speech.<br><h3>one or more definitions, organized as follows</h3><br>    -<br>          an optional number, present if there are several definitions.<br>          Lowercase letters might also be used in cases where<br>          subdefinitions of a numbered definition are necessary.<br>    -<br>          an optional part of speech, set in italics, present if the term<br>          is one of several parts of speech.<br>    -<br>          an optional discipline, set in italics, present if the term has<br>          a standard definition being repeated. For example, "Math."<br>    -<br>          an optional context, present if this definition is meaningful<br>          only in that context. For example, "(of a symbol)".<br>    -<br>          the definition.<br>    -<br>          an optional example sentence. For example, "This is an example<br>          of an example."<br>    -<br>          optional cross references.<br>In addition, some terms have idiomatic usage in the Common Lisp community<br>which is not shared by other communities, or which is not technically<br>correct.  Definitions labeled "Idiom." represent such idiomatic usage;<br>these definitions are sometimes followed by an explanatory note.<br>Words in this font are words with entries in the glossary.  Words in<br>example sentences do not follow this convention.<br>When an ambiguity arises, the longest matching substring has precedence.<br>For example, "complex float" refers to a single glossary entry for<br>"complex float" rather than the combined meaning of the glossary terms<br>"complex" and "float."<br>Subscript notation, as in "something_n" means that the nth definition of<br>"something" is intended.  This notation is used only in situations where<br>the context might be insufficient to disambiguate.<br>The following are abbreviations used in the glossary:<br>Abbreviation       Meaning<br>adj.<br>     adjective<br>adv.<br>     adverb<br>ANSI<br>     compatible with one or more ANSI standards<br>Comp.<br>     computers<br>Idiom.<br>     idiomatic<br>IEEE<br>     compatible with one or more IEEE standards<br>ISO<br>     compatible with one or more ISO standards<br>Math.<br>     mathematics<br>Trad.<br>     traditional<br>n.<br>     noun<br>v.<br>     verb<br>v.t.<br>     transitive verb<br>    ()<br>          pronounced 'nil , n.  an alternative notation for writing the<br>          symbol~nil, used to emphasize the use of nil as an empty list.<br>A<br>-<br>    absolute<br>          adj.  1.

See also extended function designator.<br>    function form<br>          n.  a form that is a list and that has a first element which is<br>          the name of a function to be called on arguments which are the<br>          result of evaluating subsequent elements of the function form.<br>    function name<br>          n. (in an environment) A symbol or a list (setf symbol) that is<br>          the name of a function in that environment.<br>    functional evaluation<br>          n.  the process of extracting a functional value from a function<br>          name or a lambda expression.  The evaluator performs functional<br>          evaluation implicitly when it encounters a function name or a<br>          lambda expression in the car of a compound form, or explicitly<br>          when it encounters a function special form.  Neither a use of a<br>          symbol as a function designator nor a use of the function<br>          symbol-function to extract the functional value of a symbol is<br>          considered a functional evaluation.<br>    functional value<br>          n.  1. (of a function name N in an environment E) The value of<br>          the binding named N in the function namespace for environment E;<br>          that is, the contents of the function cell named N in<br>          environment E.  2. (of an fbound symbol S) the contents of the<br>          symbol's function cell; that is, the value of the binding named S<br>          in the function namespace of the global environment.  (A name<br>          that is a macro name in the global environment or is a special<br>          operator might or might not be fbound.  But if S is such a name<br>          and is fbound, the specific nature of its functional value is<br>          implementation-dependent; in particular, it might or might not<br>          be a function.)<br>    further compilation<br>          n.  implementation-dependent compilation beyond minimal<br>          compilation.  Further compilation is permitted to take place at<br>          run time.

See<br>          boolean.<br>    generalized instance<br>          n. (of a class) an object the class of which is either that<br>          class itself, or some subclass of that class.  (Because of the<br>          correspondence between types and classes, the term "generalized<br>          instance of X" implies "object of type X" and in cases where X<br>          is a class (or class name) the reverse is also true.  The former<br>          terminology emphasizes the view of X as a class while the latter<br>          emphasizes the view of X as a type specifier.)<br>    generalized reference<br>          n.  a reference to a location storing an object as if to a<br>          variable.  (Such a reference can be either to read or write the<br>          location.) See <a href="Generalized Reference.html">Generalized Reference</a>.

(of a character) being a "printing" or "displayable"<br>          character that has a standard visual representation as a single<br>          glyph, such as A or * or =.

(of a symbol) the package, if any, which is contents of the<br>          package cell of the symbol, and which dictates how the Lisp<br>          printer prints the symbol when it is not accessible in the<br>          current package.

A conforming<br>          implementation is encouraged (but not required) to document its<br>          treatment of each item in this specification which is marked<br>          implementation-dependent, although in some cases such<br>          documentation might simply identify the item as "undefined."<br>    implementation-independent<br>          adj.  used to identify or emphasize a behavior or aspect of<br>          Common Lisp which does not vary between conforming<br>          implementations.<br>    implicit block<br>          n.  a block introduced by a macro form rather than by an<br>          explicit block form.<br>    implicit compilation<br>          n.  compilation performed during evaluation.<br>    implicit progn<br>          n.  an ordered set of adjacent forms appearing in another form,<br>          and defined by their context in that form to be executed as if<br>          within a progn.<br>    implicit tagbody<br>          n.  an ordered set of adjacent forms and/or tags appearing in<br>          another form, and defined by their context in that form to be<br>          executed as if within a tagbody.<br>    import<br>          v.t.

A<br>          Lisp image is characterized by a single address space in which<br>          any object can directly refer to any another in conformance with<br>          this specification, and by a single, common, global environment.<br>          (External operating systems sometimes call this a ``core image,"<br>          ``fork," ``incarnation," ``job," or "process."  Note however,<br>          that the issue of a "process" in such an operating system is<br>          technically orthogonal to the issue of a Lisp image being<br>          defined here.  Depending on the operating system, a single<br>          "process" might have multiple Lisp images, and multiple<br>          "processes" might reside in a single Lisp image.  Hence, it is<br>          the idea of a fully shared address space for direct reference<br>          among all objects which is the defining characteristic.  Note,<br>          too, that two "processes" which have a communication area that<br>          permits the sharing of some but not all objects are considered<br>          to be distinct Lisp images.)<br>    Lisp printer<br>          n.

In many implementations,<br>          the default mode of interaction with Common Lisp during program<br>          development is through such a loop.<br>    Lisp reader<br>          n. Trad.  the procedure that parses character representations of<br>          objects from a stream, producing objects.

(of a list) the set of conses that make up the list.  Note<br>          that while the car_{1b} component of each such cons is part of<br>          the list structure, the objects that are elements of the list<br>          (i.e., the objects that are the cars_2 of each cons in the list)<br>          are not themselves part of its list structure, even if they are<br>          conses, except in the (circular_2) case where the list actually<br>          contains one of its tails as an element.  (The list structure of<br>          a list is sometimes redundantly referred to as its "top-level<br>          list structure" in order to emphasize that any conses that are<br>          elements of the list are not involved.)<br>    literal<br>          adj.

(Note that because the representation of a logical host<br>          is implementation-dependent, it is possible that an<br>          implementation might represent a logical host as the string that<br>          names it.)<br>    logical pathname<br>          n.  an object of type logical-pathname.<br>    long float<br>          n.  an object of type long-float.<br>    loop keyword<br>          n.

This description is beyond the scope of this document,<br>          and no conforming implementation is required to adhere to it<br>          except as noted explicitly in this specification.

(of a<br>          character) a string that names the character and that has length<br>          greater than one.  (All non-graphic characters are required to<br>          have names unless they have some implementation-defined attribute<br>          which is not null.

(It<br>          is common, both within this document and in observed spoken<br>          behavior, to refer to an empty string by an apparent definite<br>          reference, as in "the null string" even though no attempt is<br>          made to intern_2 null strings.  The phrase ``a null string" is<br>          technically more correct, but is generally considered awkward by<br>          most Lisp programmers.  As such, the phrase "the null string"<br>          should be treated as an indefinite reference in all cases except<br>          for anaphoric references.) c.

Since optimizing one such<br>          quality might conflict with optimizing another, relative<br>          priorities for qualities can be established in an optimize<br>          declaration.  The standardized optimize qualities are<br>          compilation-speed (speed of the compilation process),<br>          debug (ease of debugging),<br>          safety (run-time error checking), space (both code size and<br>          run-time space), and speed (of the object code).<br>          Implementations may define additional optimize qualities.<br>    optional parameter<br>          n.

See the function symbol-package.<br>    package designator<br>          n.  a designator for a package; that is, an object that denotes<br>          a package and that is one of: a string designator (denoting the<br>          package that has the string that it designates as its name or as<br>          one of its nicknames), or a package (denoting itself).<br>    package marker<br>          n.  a character which is used in the textual notation for a<br>          symbol to separate the package name from the symbol name, and<br>          which is colon in the standard readtable.  See <a href="Character           Syntax">Character<br>          Syntax</a>.<br>    package prefix<br>          n.  a notation preceding the name of a symbol in text that is<br>          processed by the Lisp reader, which uses a package name followed<br>          by one or more package markers, and which indicates that the<br>          symbol is looked up in the indicated package.<br>    package registry<br>          n.  A mapping of names to package objects.  It is possible for<br>          there to be a package object which is not in this mapping; such<br>          a package is called an unregistered package.  Operators such as<br>          find-package consult this mapping in order to find a package<br>          from its name.  Operators such as do-all-symbols,<br>          find-all-symbols, and list-all-packages operate only on packages<br>          that exist in the package registry.<br>    pairwise<br>          adv. (of an adjective on a set) applying individually to all<br>          possible pairings of elements of the set.

(of binding or assignment) done in the style of<br>          psetq, let, or do; that is, first evaluating all of the forms<br>          that produce values, and only then assigning or binding the<br>          variables (or places).  Note that this does not imply<br>          traditional computational "parallelism" since the forms that<br>          produce values are evaluated sequentially.  See sequential.<br>    parameter<br>          n.  1. (of a function) a variable in the definition of a function<br>          which takes on the value of a corresponding argument (or of a<br>          list of corresponding arguments) to that function when it is<br>          called, or which in some cases is given a default value because<br>          there is no corresponding argument.  2. (of a format directive)<br>          an object received as data flow by a format directive due to a<br>          prefix notation within the format string at the format<br>          directive's point of use.

(Common Lisp provides no program interface to<br>          cause this to occur, but the semantics of Common Lisp are such<br>          that every implementation must be able to do this internally,<br>          and some situations involving type specifiers are most easily<br>          described in terms of a fully expanded type specifier.)<br>    type specifier<br>          n.  an expression that denotes a type.
