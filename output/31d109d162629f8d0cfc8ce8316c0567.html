                        Each entry in this glossary has the following parts:<br>*<br>     the term being defined, set in boldface.<br>*<br>     optional pronunciation, enclosed in square brackets and set in<br>     boldface, as in the following example: pronounced 'a ,list .  The<br>     pronunciation key follows Webster's Third New International Dictionary<br>     the English Language, Unabridged, except that "e" is used to notate<br>     the schwa (upside-down "e") character.<br>*<br>     the part or parts of speech, set in italics.  If a term can be used<br>     as several parts of speech, there is a separate definition for each<br>     part of speech.<br><h3>one or more definitions, organized as follows</h3><br>    -<br>          an optional number, present if there are several definitions.<br>          Lowercase letters might also be used in cases where<br>          subdefinitions of a numbered definition are necessary.<br>    -<br>          an optional part of speech, set in italics, present if the term<br>          is one of several parts of speech.<br>    -<br>          an optional discipline, set in italics, present if the term has<br>          a standard definition being repeated. For example, "Math."<br>    -<br>          an optional context, present if this definition is meaningful<br>          only in that context. For example, "(of a symbol)".<br>    -<br>          the definition.<br>    -<br>          an optional example sentence. For example, "This is an example<br>          of an example."<br>    -<br>          optional cross references.<br>In addition, some terms have idiomatic usage in the Common Lisp community<br>which is not shared by other communities, or which is not technically<br>correct.  Definitions labeled "Idiom." represent such idiomatic usage;<br>these definitions are sometimes followed by an explanatory note.<br>Words in this font are words with entries in the glossary.  Words in<br>example sentences do not follow this convention.<br>When an ambiguity arises, the longest matching substring has precedence.<br>For example, "complex float" refers to a single glossary entry for<br>"complex float" rather than the combined meaning of the glossary terms<br>"complex" and "float."<br>Subscript notation, as in "something_n" means that the nth definition of<br>"something" is intended.  This notation is used only in situations where<br>the context might be insufficient to disambiguate.<br>The following are abbreviations used in the glossary:<br>Abbreviation       Meaning<br>adj.<br>     adjective<br>adv.<br>     adverb<br>ANSI<br>     compatible with one or more ANSI standards<br>Comp.<br>     computers<br>Idiom.<br>     idiomatic<br>IEEE<br>     compatible with one or more IEEE standards<br>ISO<br>     compatible with one or more ISO standards<br>Math.<br>     mathematics<br>Trad.<br>     traditional<br>n.<br>     noun<br>v.<br>     verb<br>v.t.<br>     transitive verb<br>    ()<br>          pronounced 'nil , n.  an alternative notation for writing the<br>          symbol~nil, used to emphasize the use of nil as an empty list.<br>A<br>-<br>    absolute<br>          adj.  1.

See also extended function designator.<br>    function form<br>          n.  a form that is a list and that has a first element which is<br>          the name of a function to be called on arguments which are the<br>          result of evaluating subsequent elements of the function form.<br>    function name<br>          n. (in an environment) A symbol or a list (setf symbol) that is<br>          the name of a function in that environment.<br>    functional evaluation<br>          n.  the process of extracting a functional value from a function<br>          name or a lambda expression.  The evaluator performs functional<br>          evaluation implicitly when it encounters a function name or a<br>          lambda expression in the car of a compound form, or explicitly<br>          when it encounters a function special form.  Neither a use of a<br>          symbol as a function designator nor a use of the function<br>          symbol-function to extract the functional value of a symbol is<br>          considered a functional evaluation.<br>    functional value<br>          n.  1. (of a function name N in an environment E) The value of<br>          the binding named N in the function namespace for environment E;<br>          that is, the contents of the function cell named N in<br>          environment E.  2. (of an fbound symbol S) the contents of the<br>          symbol's function cell; that is, the value of the binding named S<br>          in the function namespace of the global environment.  (A name<br>          that is a macro name in the global environment or is a special<br>          operator might or might not be fbound.  But if S is such a name<br>          and is fbound, the specific nature of its functional value is<br>          implementation-dependent; in particular, it might or might not<br>          be a function.)<br>    further compilation<br>          n.  implementation-dependent compilation beyond minimal<br>          compilation.  Further compilation is permitted to take place at<br>          run time.

See<br>          boolean.<br>    generalized instance<br>          n. (of a class) an object the class of which is either that<br>          class itself, or some subclass of that class.  (Because of the<br>          correspondence between types and classes, the term "generalized<br>          instance of X" implies "object of type X" and in cases where X<br>          is a class (or class name) the reverse is also true.  The former<br>          terminology emphasizes the view of X as a class while the latter<br>          emphasizes the view of X as a type specifier.)<br>    generalized reference<br>          n.  a reference to a location storing an object as if to a<br>          variable.  (Such a reference can be either to read or write the<br>          location.) See <a href="6c0786a3cee8c5dad2a1326f6c70638c.html">Generalized Reference</a>.

Trad.  an endless loop that reads_2 a form, evaluates it, and<br>          prints (i.e., writes_2) the results.

(of a list) the set of conses that make up the list.  Note<br>          that while the car_{1b} component of each such cons is part of<br>          the list structure, the objects that are elements of the list<br>          (i.e., the objects that are the cars_2 of each cons in the list)<br>          are not themselves part of its list structure, even if they are<br>          conses, except in the (circular_2) case where the list actually<br>          contains one of its tails as an element.  (The list structure of<br>          a list is sometimes redundantly referred to as its "top-level<br>          list structure" in order to emphasize that any conses that are<br>          elements of the list are not involved.)<br>    literal<br>          adj. (of an object) referenced directly in a program rather than<br>          being computed by the program; that is, appearing as data in a<br>          quote form, or, if the object is a self-evaluating object,<br>          appearing as unquoted data.

(Note that because the representation of a logical host<br>          is implementation-dependent, it is possible that an<br>          implementation might represent a logical host as the string that<br>          names it.)<br>    logical pathname<br>          n.  an object of type logical-pathname.<br>    long float<br>          n.  an object of type long-float.<br>    loop keyword<br>          n.

This description is beyond the scope of this document,<br>          and no conforming implementation is required to adhere to it<br>          except as noted explicitly in this specification.  Nevertheless,<br>          its existence helps to establish normative practice, and<br>          implementors with no reason to diverge from it are encouraged to<br>          consider making their implementation adhere to it where possible.<br>          It is described in detail in The Art of the Metaobject Protocol.<br>    method<br>          n.  an object that is part of a generic function and which<br>          provides information about how that generic function should<br>          behave when its arguments are objects of certain classes or with<br>          certain identities.<br>    method combination<br>          n.  1. generally, the composition of a set of methods to produce<br>          an effective method for a generic function.  2. an object of<br>          type method-combination, which represents the details of how the<br>          method combination_1 for one or more specific generic functions<br>          is to be performed.<br>    method-defining form<br>          n.  a form that defines a method for a generic function, whether<br>          explicitly or implicitly.

The phrase ``a null string" is<br>          technically more correct, but is generally considered awkward by<br>          most Lisp programmers.  As such, the phrase "the null string"<br>          should be treated as an indefinite reference in all cases except<br>          for anaphoric references.) c.

Since optimizing one such<br>          quality might conflict with optimizing another, relative<br>          priorities for qualities can be established in an optimize<br>          declaration.  The standardized optimize qualities are<br>          compilation-speed (speed of the compilation process),<br>          debug (ease of debugging),<br>          safety (run-time error checking), space (both code size and<br>          run-time space), and speed (of the object code).<br>          Implementations may define additional optimize qualities.<br>    optional parameter<br>          n.

A mapping of names to package objects.  It is possible for<br>          there to be a package object which is not in this mapping; such<br>          a package is called an unregistered package.  Operators such as<br>          find-package consult this mapping in order to find a package<br>          from its name.

Note that this does not imply<br>          traditional computational "parallelism" since the forms that<br>          produce values are evaluated sequentially.  See sequential.<br>    parameter<br>          n.  1.
