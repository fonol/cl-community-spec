If the\nsign of the number (as determined by float-sign) is negative, then a minus\nsign is printed before the number.  If the format of the number does not\nmatch that specified by *read-default-float-format*, then the exponent\nmarker for that format and the digit 0 are also printed.  For example, the\nbase of the natural logarithms as a short float might be printed as\n2.71828S0.\nFor non-zero magnitudes outside of the range 10^-3 to 10^7, a float is\nprinted in computerized scientific notation.  The representation of the\nnumber is scaled to be between 1 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive) and then\nprinted, with one digit before the decimal point and at least one digit\nafter the decimal point.  Next the exponent marker for the format is\nprinted, except that if the format of the number matches that specified by\n*read-default-float-format*, then the exponent marker E is used.  Finally,\nthe power of ten by which the fraction must be multiplied to equal the\noriginal number is printed as a decimal integer.  For example, Avogadro's\nnumber as a short float is printed as 6.02S23.\nFor related information about the syntax of a float, see *Note Syntax of a\nFloat::.\n"
