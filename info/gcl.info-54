Requirements for removed and deprecated features
------------------------------------------------

For this standard, some features from the language described in Common
Lisp: The Language have been removed, and others have been deprecated (and
will most likely not appear in future Common Lisp standards).  Which
features were removed and which were deprecated was decided on a
case-by-case basis by the X3J13 committee.

Conforming implementations that wish to retain any removed features for
compatibility must assure that such compatibility does not interfere with
the correct function of conforming programs.  For example, symbols
corresponding to the names of removed functions may not appear in the the
COMMON-LISP package.  (Note, however, that this specification has been
devised in such a way that there can be a package named LISP which can
contain such symbols.)

Conforming implementations must implement all deprecated features.  For a
list of deprecated features, see *Note Deprecated Language Features::.

Removed Types
-------------

The type string-char was removed.


File: gcl.info,  Node: Removed Operators,  Next: Removed Argument Conventions,  Prev: Removed Types,  Up: Removed Language Features

Removed Operators
-----------------

The functions

int-char , char-bits , char-font , make-char , char-bit , set-char-bit ,
string-char-p ,

and commonp

were removed.

The special operator compiler-let was removed.


File: gcl.info,  Node: Removed Argument Conventions,  Next: Removed Variables,  Prev: Removed Operators,  Up: Removed Language Features

Removed Argument Conventions
----------------------------

The font argument to digit-char was removed.  The bits and font arguments
to code-char

were removed.


File: gcl.info,  Node: Removed Variables,  Next: Removed Reader Syntax,  Prev: Removed Argument Conventions,  Up: Removed Language Features

Removed Variables
-----------------

The variables

char-font-limit , char-bits-limit , char-control-bit , char-meta-bit ,
char-super-bit , char-hyper-bit ,

and *break-on-warnings*

were removed.


File: gcl.info,  Node: Removed Reader Syntax,  Next: Packages No Longer Required,  Prev: Removed Variables,  Up: Removed Language Features

Removed Reader Syntax
---------------------

The "#," reader macro in standard syntax was removed.


File: gcl.info,  Node: Packages No Longer Required,  Prev: Removed Reader Syntax,  Up: Removed Language Features

Packages No Longer Required
---------------------------

The packages LISP , USER , and SYSTEM

are no longer required.  It is valid for packages with one or more of these
names to be provided by a conforming implementation as extensions.
