### Common Lisp CommunitySpec

This project aims to provide an alternative to the [Common Lisp HyperSpec](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm).
Due to its license, the HyperSpec cannot be modified in any way, so this project 
is using a rendition of the ANSI Common Lisp specification draft, which is available in `.info` or `.tex` format on various locations.

A more or less recent live version of the repository can be found at [cl-community-spec.github.io](https://cl-community-spec.github.io)

For the syntax highlighting, [orthecreedence/highlight-lisp](https://github.com/orthecreedence/highlight-lisp) is used.

The content is left unchanged at this stage*, the only work right now goes into the presentation.

\* with the exception that I added a "Backlinks" section at the end of each page, if there are any links pointing to that page
