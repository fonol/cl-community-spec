### Common Lisp CommunitySpec

This project aims to provide an alternative to the [Common Lisp HyperSpec](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm).
Due to its license, the HyperSpec cannot be modified in any way, so this project 
is using a rendition of the ANSI Common Lisp specification draft, which is available in `.info` or `.tex` format on various locations.

A more or less recent live version of the repository can be found at [cl-community-spec.github.io](https://cl-community-spec.github.io)

For the syntax highlighting, [orthecreedence/highlight-lisp](https://github.com/orthecreedence/highlight-lisp) is used.

PRs welcome!

### Note for contributing

The generated HTML is kind of messy, but please be careful with auto-formatting tools. A lot of the HTML is preformatted, and not all of the
preformatted text sits inside `<pre></pre>` tags yet.
