<h4 class="subsubsection">12.1.4.3 Rule of Float Approximation</h4>

<p>Computations with <i>floats</i> are only approximate,
although they are described as if the results
were mathematically accurate. 
Two mathematically identical
expressions may be computationally different because of errors
inherent in the floating-point approximation process.
The precision of a <i>float</i> is not necessarily
correlated with the accuracy of that number.
For instance, 3.142857142857142857 is a more precise approximation
to \pi than 3.14159, but the latter is more accurate.
The precision refers to the number of bits retained in the representation.
When an operation combines a <i>short float</i> with a 
<i>long float</i>,
the result will be a <i>long float</i>. 
<span class="roman">Common Lisp</span> functions assume that the accuracy of
arguments to them does not exceed their precision.  Therefore
when two <i>small floats</i> 
are combined, the result is a <i>small float</i>. 
<span class="roman">Common Lisp</span> functions 
never convert automatically from a larger size to a smaller one.
