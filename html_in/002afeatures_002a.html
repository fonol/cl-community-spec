<h4 class="subsubheading">Description::</h4>

<p>The <i>value</i> of <a href="002afeatures_002a.html">*features*</a> is called the <i>features list</i>.  
It is a <i>list</i> of <i>symbols</i>, called <i>features</i>, 
that correspond to some aspect of the <i>implementation</i> or <i>environment</i>.
</p>
<p>Most <i>features</i> have <i>implementation-dependent</i> meanings;
The following meanings have been assigned to feature names:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><tt>:cltl1</tt></dt>
<dd><p>If present, indicates that the <tt>LISP</tt> <i>package</i> <i>purports to conform</i>
to the 1984 specification <i>Common Lisp: The Language</i>.  
It is possible, but not required, for a <i>conforming implementation</i> 
to have this feature because this specification specifies that 
its <i>symbols</i> are to be in the <tt>COMMON-LISP</tt> <i>package</i>, 
not the <tt>LISP</tt> package.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt>:cltl2</tt></dt>
<dd><p>If present, indicates that the implementation <i>purports to conform</i>
to <i>Common Lisp: The Language, Second Edition</i>.
This feature must not be present in any <i>conforming implementation</i>,
since conformance to that document is not compatible with conformance
to this specification.
The name, however, is reserved by this specification in order to help
programs distinguish implementations which conform to that document
from implementations which conform to this specification.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt>:ieee-floating-point</tt></dt>
<dd><p>If present, indicates that the implementation <i>purports to conform</i>
to the requirements of <i>IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic</i>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt>:x3j13</tt></dt>
<dd><p>If present, indicates that the implementation conforms to some
particular working draft of this specification, 
or to some subset of features that approximates a belief about
what this specification might turn out to contain.
A <i>conforming implementation</i> might or might not contain
such a feature.
(This feature is intended primarily as a stopgap in order to 
provide implementors something to use prior to the availability
of a draft standard, in order to discourage them from introducing
the <tt>:draft-ansi-cl</tt> and <tt>:ansi-cl</tt> <i>features</i> prematurely.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt>:draft-ansi-cl</tt></dt>
<dd><p>If present, indicates that the <i>implementation</i> 
<i>purports to conform</i> to the first full draft of this specification,
which went to public review in 1992.
A <i>conforming implementation</i>
which has the <tt>:draft-ansi-cl-2</tt> or <tt>:ansi-cl</tt> <i>feature</i>
is not permitted to retain the <tt>:draft-ansi-cl</tt> <i>feature</i>
since incompatible changes were made subsequent to the first draft.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt>:draft-ansi-cl-2</tt></dt>
<dd><p>If present, indicates that a second full draft of this specification
has gone to public review, and that the <i>implementation</i> 
<i>purports to conform</i> to that specification.
(If additional public review drafts are produced, this keyword
 will continue to refer to the second draft, and additional keywords
 will be added to identify conformance with such later drafts.
 As such, the meaning of this keyword can be relied upon not to
 change over time.)
A <i>conforming implementation</i> which has the <tt>:ansi-cl</tt>
<i>feature</i> is only permitted to retain the <tt>:draft-ansi-cl</tt> 
<i>feature</i> if the finally approved standard is not incompatible
with the draft standard.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt>:ansi-cl</tt></dt>
<dd><p>If present, indicates that this specification has been adopted by ANSI
as an official standard, and that the <i>implementation</i> 
<i>purports to conform</i>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt>:common-lisp</tt></dt>
<dd><p>This feature must appear in <a href="002afeatures_002a.html">*features*</a> for any implementation that
has one or more of the features <tt>:x3j13</tt>, <tt>:draft-ansi-cl</tt>,
or <tt>:ansi-cl</tt>.  It is intended that it should also appear in
implementations which have the features <tt>:cltl1</tt> or <tt>:cltl2</tt>,
but this specification cannot force such behavior.  The intent is 
that this feature should identify the language family named "Common Lisp,"
rather than some specific dialect within that family.

<h4 class="subsubheading">Notes::</h4>

<p>The <i>value</i> of <a href="002afeatures_002a.html">*features*</a> is used by the <tt>#+</tt> and <tt>#-</tt> reader syntax.
</p>
<p><i>Symbols</i> in the <i>features list</i> may be in any <i>package</i>,
but in practice they are generally in the <tt>KEYWORD</tt> <i>package</i>.
This is because <tt>KEYWORD</tt> is the <i>package</i> used by default
when <i>reading</i>_2 <i>feature expressions</i> 
in the <tt>#+</tt> and <tt>#-</tt> <i>reader macros</i>.
<i>Code</i> that needs to name a <i>feature</i>_2 in a
<i>package</i> P (other than <tt>KEYWORD</tt>) can do so
by making explicit use of a <i>package prefix</i> for P,
but note that such <i>code</i> must also assure that the <i>package</i> P 
exists in order for the <i>feature expression</i> to be <i>read</i>_2&mdash;even
in cases where the <i>feature expression</i> is expected to fail.
</p>
<p>It is generally considered wise for an <i>implementation</i> to include 
one or more <i>features</i> identifying the specific <i>implementation</i>,
so that conditional expressions can be written which distinguish 
idiosyncrasies of one <i>implementation</i> from those of another.  
Since features are normally <i>symbols</i> in the <tt>KEYWORD</tt> <i>package</i>
where name collisions might easily result, and since no uniquely defined mechanism
is designated for deciding who has the right to use which <i>symbol</i> for
what reason, a conservative strategy is to prefer names derived from 
one&rsquo;s own company or product name, since those names are often trademarked
and are hence less likely to be used unwittingly by another <i>implementation</i>.
