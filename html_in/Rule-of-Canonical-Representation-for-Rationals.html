<h4 class="subsubsection">12.1.3.2 Rule of Canonical Representation for Rationals</h4>

<p>If any computation produces a result that is a mathematical ratio of two integers
such that the denominator evenly divides the numerator, then the result is converted
to the equivalent <i>integer</i>.  
</p>
<p>If the denominator does not evenly divide the numerator,
the canonical representation of a <i>rational</i> number is as the <i>ratio</i>
that numerator and that denominator, where the greatest common divisor of
the numerator and denominator is one, and where the denominator is positive
and greater than one.
</p>
<p>When used as input (in the default syntax),
the notation <tt>-0</tt> always denotes the <i>integer</i> <tt>0</tt>.
A <i>conforming implementation</i> must not have a
representation of "minus zero" for <i>integers</i>
that is distinct from its representation of zero for <i>integers</i>.
However, such a distinction is possible for <i>floats</i>; 
see the <i>type</i> <b><a href="float.html">float</a></b>.
