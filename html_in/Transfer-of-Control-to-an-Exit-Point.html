<h3 class="section">5.2 Transfer of Control to an Exit Point</h3>


<p>When a transfer of control is initiated by <b><a href="go.html">go</a></b>, 
<a href="return_002dfrom.html">return-from</a>, or <b><a href="throw.html">throw</a></b>
the following events occur in order to accomplish the transfer of control.
Note that for <b><a href="go.html">go</a></b>, 
the <i>exit point</i> is the <i>form</i> within the <b><a href="tagbody.html">tagbody</a></b>
that is being executed at the time the <b><a href="go.html">go</a></b> is performed;
for <a href="return_002dfrom.html">return-from</a>,
the <i>exit point</i> is the corresponding 
<b><a href="block.html">block</a></b> <i>form</i>;
and for <b><a href="throw.html">throw</a></b>,
the <i>exit point</i> is the corresponding 
<b><a href="catch.html">catch</a></b> <i>form</i>. 
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd><p>Intervening <i>exit points</i> are "abandoned"
 (<i>i.e.</i>, their <i>extent</i> ends 
      and it is no longer valid to attempt to transfer control through them).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd><p>The cleanup clauses of any intervening <a href="unwind_002dprotect.html">unwind-protect</a> clauses
 are evaluated.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd><p>Intervening dynamic <i>bindings</i> of <b><a href="special.html">special</a></b> variables,
 <i>catch tags</i>, <i>condition handlers</i>, and <i>restarts</i>
 are undone.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>4.</dt>
<dd><p>The <i>extent</i> of the <i>exit point</i> being invoked ends,
 and control is passed to the target.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The extent of an exit being "abandoned" because it is being passed over
ends as soon as the transfer of control is initiated. That is,
event 1 occurs at the beginning of the initiation of the transfer of
control. 
The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to transfer control 
to an <i>exit point</i> whose <i>dynamic extent</i> has ended.
</p>
<p>Events 2 and 3 are actually performed interleaved, in the order
corresponding to the reverse order in which they were established.
The effect of this is that the cleanup clauses of an <a href="unwind_002dprotect.html">unwind-protect</a>
see the same dynamic <i>bindings</i> 
of variables and <i>catch tags</i> as were
visible when the <a href="unwind_002dprotect.html">unwind-protect</a> was entered.
</p>
<p>Event 4 occurs at the end of the transfer of control.
