<h4 class="subsubsection">21.1.1.4 Interactive Streams</h4>

<p>An <i>interactive stream</i>
<a name="index-interactive-stream"></a>
 is one on which it makes sense to perform
interactive querying.
</p>
<p>The precise meaning of an <i>interactive stream</i> is
<i>implementation-defined</i>, and may depend on the underlying
operating system.  Some examples of the things that an
<i>implementation</i> might choose to use as identifying characteristics
of an <i>interactive stream</i> include:
</p>
<ul><li><p>The <i>stream</i> is connected to a person (or equivalent) in such a way
  that the program can prompt for information and expect to receive different
  input depending on the prompt.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The program is expected to prompt for input and support "normal input editing".
</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="read_002dchar.html">read-char</a> might wait for the user to type something before returning
  instead of immediately returning a character or end-of-file. 
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The general intent of having some <i>streams</i> be classified as
<i>interactive streams</i> is to allow them to be distinguished from
streams containing batch (or background or command-file) input.
Output to batch streams is typically discarded or saved for later viewing, 
so interactive queries to such streams might not have the expected effect.
</p>
<p><i>Terminal I/O</i> might or might not be an <i>interactive stream</i>.
