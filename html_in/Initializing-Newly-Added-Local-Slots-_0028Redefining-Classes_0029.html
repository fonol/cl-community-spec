<h4 class="subsubsection">4.3.6.2 Initializing Newly Added Local Slots</h4>

<p>The second step initializes the newly added <i>local slots</i> and performs
any other user-defined actions.  This step is implemented by the generic
function <a href="update_002dinstance_002dfor_002dredefined_002dclass.html">update-instance-for-redefined-class</a>, which is called after
completion of the first step of modifying the structure of the
<i>instance</i>.
</p>
<p>The generic function <a href="update_002dinstance_002dfor_002dredefined_002dclass.html">update-instance-for-redefined-class</a> takes
four required arguments: the <i>instance</i> being updated after it has
undergone the first step, a list of the names of <i>local slots</i> that were
added, a list of the names of <i>local slots</i> that were discarded, and a
property list containing the <i>slot</i> names and values of 
<i>slots</i> that were
discarded and had values.  Included among the discarded <i>slots</i> are
<i>slots</i> that were local in the old <i>class</i> and that are shared in the new
<i>class</i>.
</p>
<p>The generic function <a href="update_002dinstance_002dfor_002dredefined_002dclass.html">update-instance-for-redefined-class</a> also
takes any number of initialization arguments.  When it is called by
the system to update an <i>instance</i> whose <i>class</i> 
has been redefined, no
initialization arguments are provided.
</p>
<p>There is a system-supplied primary <i>method</i> for 
<a href="update_002dinstance_002dfor_002dredefined_002dclass.html">update-instance-for-redefined-class</a> whose <i>parameter specializer</i>
for its <i>instance</i> argument is the <i>class</i> <a href="standard_002dobject.html">standard-object</a>.  
First this <i>method</i> checks the validity of initialization arguments and signals an
error if an initialization argument is supplied that is not declared
as valid.  (For more information, see <a href="Declaring-the-Validity-of-Initialization-Arguments.html#Declaring-the-Validity-of-Initialization-Arguments">Declaring the Validity of Initialization Arguments</a>.)
Then it calls the generic function
<b>shared-initialize</b> with the following arguments: the 
<i>instance</i>,
the list of <i>names</i> of 
the newly added <i>slots</i>, and the initialization
arguments it received.
