<h4 class="subsubsection">4.3.6.1 Modifying the Structure of Instances</h4>

<p>[Reviewer Note by Barmar: What about shared slots that are deleted?]
</p>
<p>The first step modifies the structure of <i>instances</i> of the redefined
<i>class</i> to conform to its new <i>class</i> definition.  
<i>Local slots</i> specified
by the new <i>class</i> definition that are not specified as either local or
shared by the old <i>class</i> are added, and <i>slots</i> 
not specified as either
local or shared by the new <i>class</i> definition that are specified as
local by the old <i>class</i> are discarded. 
The <i>names</i> of these added and discarded
<i>slots</i> are passed as arguments 
to <a href="update_002dinstance_002dfor_002dredefined_002dclass.html">update-instance-for-redefined-class</a>
as described in the next section.
</p>
<p>The values of <i>local slots</i> specified by both the new and old
<i>classes</i> are retained. If such a <i>local slot</i> was unbound,
it remains unbound.
</p>
<p>The value of a <i>slot</i> that is specified as shared in the old 
<i>class</i> and as local in the new <i>class</i> is retained.  If such 
a <i>shared slot</i> was unbound, the <i>local slot</i> is unbound.
