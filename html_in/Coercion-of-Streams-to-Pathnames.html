<h4 class="subsection">20.1.1 Coercion of Streams to Pathnames</h4>

<p>A <i>stream associated with a file</i>
<a name="index-stream-associated-with-a-file"></a>
 is either a <i>file stream</i>
or a <i>synonym stream</i> whose target is a <i>stream associated with a file</i>
<a name="index-stream-associated-with-a-file-1"></a>
.
Such streams can be used as <i>pathname designators</i>.
</p>
<p>Normally, when a <i>stream associated with a file</i> is used as a
<i>pathname designator</i>, it denotes the <i>pathname</i> used to 
open the <i>file</i>; this may be, but is not required to be, the
actual name of the <i>file</i>.
</p>
<p>Some functions, such as <b><a href="truename.html">truename</a></b> and <a href="delete_002dfile.html">delete-file</a>,
coerce <i>streams</i> to <i>pathnames</i> in a different way that 
involves referring to the actual <i>file</i> that is open, which might
or might not be the file whose name was opened originally.  Such special
situations are always notated specifically and are not the default.
