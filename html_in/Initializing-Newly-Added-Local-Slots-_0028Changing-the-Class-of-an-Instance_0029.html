<h4 class="subsection">7.2.2 Initializing Newly Added Local Slots</h4>

<p>The second step of the update initializes the newly added <i>slots</i> and
performs any other user-defined actions.  This step is implemented by
the generic function <a href="update_002dinstance_002dfor_002ddifferent_002dclass.html">update-instance-for-different-class</a>.  The
generic function <a href="update_002dinstance_002dfor_002ddifferent_002dclass.html">update-instance-for-different-class</a> is invoked
by <a href="change_002dclass.html">change-class</a> after the first step of the update has been
completed.
</p>
<p>The generic function <a href="update_002dinstance_002dfor_002ddifferent_002dclass.html">update-instance-for-different-class</a> is
invoked on arguments computed by <a href="change_002dclass.html">change-class</a>.
The first argument passed is a copy of the <i>instance</i> being updated 
and is an <i>instance</i> of the class C_{from}; 
this copy has <i>dynamic extent</i> within the generic function <a href="change_002dclass.html">change-class</a>.  
The second argument is the <i>instance</i> as updated so far by <a href="change_002dclass.html">change-class</a>
and is an <i>instance</i> of the class C_{to}.
The remaining arguments are an <i>initialization argument list</i>.
</p>
<p>There is a system-supplied primary <i>method</i> for 
<a href="update_002dinstance_002dfor_002ddifferent_002dclass.html">update-instance-for-different-class</a> that has two parameter
specializers, each of which is the <i>class</i> <a href="standard_002dobject.html">standard-object</a>.  First
this <i>method</i> checks the validity of initialization arguments and
signals an error if an initialization argument is supplied that is not
declared as valid.  (For more information, see <a href="Declaring-the-Validity-of-Initialization-Arguments.html#Declaring-the-Validity-of-Initialization-Arguments">Declaring the Validity of Initialization Arguments</a>.)
Then it calls the
generic function <b>shared-initialize</b> with the following arguments:
the
new
<i>instance</i>, a list of <i>names</i> of the newly added 
<i>slots</i>, and the
initialization arguments it received.
