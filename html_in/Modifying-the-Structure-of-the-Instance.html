<h4 class="subsection">7.2.1 Modifying the Structure of the Instance</h4>

<p>In order to make the <i>instance</i> conform to the class C_{to}, <i>local slots</i> specified by the class C_{to} that are not specified by the class C_{from} are added, and <i>local slots</i> not specified by
the class C_{to} that are specified by the
class C_{from} are discarded.
</p>
<p>The values of <i>local slots</i> specified by both the class C_{to} and the class C_{from} are retained. If such a <i>local slot</i> was unbound, it remains
unbound.
</p>
<p>The values of <i>slots</i> specified as shared in the class C_{from} and as local in the class C_{to} are retained.
</p>
<p>This first step of the update does not affect the values of any 
<i>shared slots</i>.
