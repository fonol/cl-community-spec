<h4 class="subsection">27.1.1 Requirements for removed and deprecated features</h4>

<p>For this standard,
    some features from the language described in <i>Common Lisp: The Language</i> have been removed,
and others have been deprecated (and will most likely not appear
in future <span class="roman">Common Lisp</span> standards).
Which features were removed and which were deprecated
was decided on a case-by-case basis by the X3J13 committee.
</p>
<p><i>Conforming implementations</i> that wish to retain any removed 
features for compatibility must assure that such compatibility 
does not interfere with the correct function of <i>conforming programs</i>.
For example, symbols corresponding to the names of removed functions
may not appear in the the <tt>COMMON-LISP</tt> <i>package</i>.
(Note, however, that this specification has been devised in such a way 
that there can be a package named <tt>LISP</tt> which can contain such symbols.)
</p>
<p><i>Conforming implementations</i> must implement all deprecated features.
For a list of deprecated features, see <a href="Deprecated-Language-Features.html#Deprecated-Language-Features">Deprecated Language Features</a>.
