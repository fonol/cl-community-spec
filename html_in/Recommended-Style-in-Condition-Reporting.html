<h4 class="subsubsection">9.1.3.1 Recommended Style in Condition Reporting</h4>

<p>In order to ensure a properly aesthetic result when presenting
<i>report messages</i> to the user, certain stylistic conventions are
recommended.
</p>
<p>There are stylistic recommendations for the content of the messages
output by <i>condition reporters</i>, but there are no formal requirements 
on those <i>programs</i>.
If a <i>program</i> violates the recommendations for some message, the
display of that message might be less aesthetic than if the guideline
had been observed, but the <i>program</i> is still considered a
<i>conforming program</i>.
</p>
<p>The requirements on a <i>program</i> or <i>implementation</i> which
invokes a <i>condition reporter</i> are somewhat stronger.  A <i>conforming
program</i> must be permitted to assume that if these style guidelines are
followed, proper aesthetics will be maintained.  Where appropriate, any
specific requirements on such routines are explicitly mentioned below.
